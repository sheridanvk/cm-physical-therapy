title: About
---

Christine received her Doctorate of Physical Therapy from New York University in 2006.  She has over 14 years of experience in orthopedics/sports rehabilitation and has worked with thousands of patients over the years on injury treatment, injury prevention and strength and conditioning to maintain a strong, healthy body.  

She got her professional start working for Columbia University Medical Center and was able to sharpen her skills working one-on-one with elite- and professional-level athletes.  She moved on to become the director of an outpatient orthopedic clinic for 4 years and decided in 2014 to establish her own practice. Throughout her career, she has had the opportunity to work with athletes in a multitude of sports, developing both individual and group workout programs for preseason and in-season injury prevention, improved efficiency and enhanced athletic performance.  She has developed individualized strength and running programs based on short-term and long-term aspirations of patients.
 
Her approach to treatment encompasses a full-body examination to determine mechanism of injury and uncover any underlying mechanical compensations the body has learned as a result of the injury.  She focuses on enforcing proper alignment, which is the key to preventing further injury as well as improving overall musculoskeletal health.  

She believes in a whole body approach when assessing all musculoskeletal injuries with a strong focus on manual therapy interventions.  She is a highly-skilled manual practitioner that focuses her uniquely-tailored one-on-one sessions with mobilization of soft/deep tissue and myofascial release.  The combination of manual therapy and a full-body approach when treating injuries allows the body to fully recover by utilizing proper mechanics and alignment which maximize strength, mobility and function.
