Our mission is to create an environment for each individual patient that focuses on proper alignment, pain relief, proper body mechanics and tissue mobility. We aim to uncover the root of the problem and treat the cause not just the underlying symptoms in order to maximize your potential and return to a pain free active lifestyle.

We're located steps away from Grand Central Terminal. See our [contact page](/contact) for more details.
