  ## Christine Meizoso Physical Therapy
---

At Christine Meizoso Physical Therapy we create an individualized patient treatment plan focused on proper alignment, pain relief, improved body mechanics and tissue mobility. Our philosophy is to uncover the root problem and treat the cause rather than just the underlying symptoms, resulting in maximized physical potential and a return to a pain-free active lifestyle.

We're located steps away from Grand Central Terminal. See our [contact page](/contact) for more details.
